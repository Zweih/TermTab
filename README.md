# TermTab

TermTab is a  Chrome and Firefox extension for new tabs that serves as startpage with a mock-terminal to execute custom commands for navigating frequently used sites. Initially created for my personal use and hosted remotely, this is currently being converted to a browser extension that can be user customized and extended.
